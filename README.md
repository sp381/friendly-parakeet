# Password Generator Starter Code

This project created to grow my skills in Javascript by the University of Arizona Bootcamp. It also used HTML and CSS but the main focus was in Javascript and how well I grasped teh language. 

The assignment was to create a password generator that would give a random password based on the criteria that was selected. 

The criteria's setup were to allow one to choose whether they wanted lowercase, uppercase, numbers or special characters in their randomly generated password. This was completed succesfully and will give you a randomly generated password. 

Please see the deployment link and generate your own password!
